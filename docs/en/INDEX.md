**Updated: 2026-09-26. Status: the controlled bilingual Phase 2 path and deterministic answer-integrity boundary are deployed across four guests.** Four fixed Linux targets, bounded Zabbix history/events, durable local-CPU answers and evidence/audit linkage are live. Earlier controlled campaigns passed source CI, bilingual model evaluation, live API, restart, rollback, WAN denial, authenticated browser, dependency recovery and serial reboot checks. The current app release has narrower, revision-specific qualification: held-out semantics, exact rollback, server-side WAN isolation and cold start remain unrun. Recovery is required again but cannot proceed without an independent destination and isolated restore lab. No local recipient-delivery route is configured. Production acceptance remains open. See the [machine-readable release status](../status/current-release.yaml).

> **Current new-server profile:** three NextOps VMs plus `zabbix-server` (4 vCPU / 16 GiB / 200 GiB) = **4 VMs / 40 vCPU / 184 GiB RAM / 980 GiB virtual disks**. Do not add the earlier small lab VM as well. [START_HERE](START_HERE.md) defines the order and Stage 1A–1E; [ZABBIX_SERVER](ZABBIX_SERVER.md) defines the monitoring VM, LVM and read-only integration.

> **Mandatory constraint:** local CPU answers, fresh local login and cold restart must work without Internet. Read [OFFLINE_RUNTIME](OFFLINE_RUNTIME.md) before choosing dependencies. GitHub is not a runtime service.

> **Delivered sequence:** Phase 1 established the evidence-linked local Zabbix answer with WAN blocked; Phase 2 adds bounded direct Linux evidence for four approved targets. Prepare the dedicated Zabbix server before Stage 1C live reads, or reuse an existing suitable authorized local instance.

## Reading paths

Begin with [START_HERE](START_HERE.md), [ZABBIX_SERVER](ZABBIX_SERVER.md) and the [deployment amendment](../requirements/DEPLOYMENT_UPDATE.md). Then review the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md), [offline contract](OFFLINE_RUNTIME.md), [storage controls](../STORAGE_PLAN.md), [server plan](SERVER_PLAN.md), [ESXi baseline](ESXI_BASELINE.md), architecture and security. Earlier three/four/five-VM tables count NextOps only; the current inclusive profile is in the Zabbix guide.

## Sources and project control

Read [SOURCES](../requirements/SOURCES.md), the [active prompt](../requirements/NEXTOPS_MASTER_PROMPT.md), the [preserved v2 source](../requirements/archive/NEXTOPS_MASTER_PROMPT_v2.0.md), [TRACEABILITY](../requirements/TRACEABILITY.md), [ADRs](../adr/README.md), [PROJECT_STATE](../PROJECT_STATE.md) and [NEXT_TASK](../NEXT_TASK.md). The [Zabbix allocation record](../requirements/ZABBIX_SERVER_PLAN.json) and [deployment amendment](../requirements/DEPLOYMENT_UPDATE.md) distinguish proposed allocations from hardware observations. The [visual review](../VISUAL_REVIEW.md) is not an offline-runtime test.

Every English guide has a same-named Persian counterpart. Update them together. Do not translate executable identifiers, protocol fields or the master prompt. Keep credentials and real infrastructure identifiers out of this public repository. Documentation and calculated budgets are not evidence of installed services or passed tests.
