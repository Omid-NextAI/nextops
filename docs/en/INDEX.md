**Updated: 2026-10-03. Status: controlled app/AI `69c9260` and Qwen3.5 are live; full production is unaccepted.** Four fixed Linux targets, bounded Zabbix history/events, saved chat, light/dark UI and evidence/audit linkage remain. Current-source functional, exact rollback and bounded queue checks passed; semantics are incomplete and its WAN/cold-start gates remain unrun. Older infrastructure passes stay dated. The Qwen3.6 candidate passed hash/import/CPU load, but both models failed the four-profile technical comparison; thinking stays off and the candidate is not selected. See [measured results](TESTING.md). Independent recovery is owner-deferred, not passed; certificate, notification, licensing and other production gates remain open. The [machine-readable release status](../status/current-release.yaml) is authoritative.

> **Current new-server profile:** three NextOps VMs plus `zabbix-server` (4 vCPU / 16 GiB / 200 GiB) = **4 VMs / 40 vCPU / 184 GiB RAM / 980 GiB virtual disks**. Do not add the earlier small lab VM as well. [START_HERE](START_HERE.md) defines the order and Stage 1A–1E; [ZABBIX_SERVER](ZABBIX_SERVER.md) defines the monitoring VM, LVM and read-only integration.

> **Mandatory constraint:** local CPU answers, fresh local login and cold restart must work without Internet. Read [OFFLINE_RUNTIME](OFFLINE_RUNTIME.md) before choosing dependencies. GitHub is not a runtime service.

> **Delivered sequence:** Phase 1 established the evidence-linked local Zabbix answer with WAN blocked; Phase 2 adds bounded direct Linux evidence for four approved targets. Prepare the dedicated Zabbix server before Stage 1C live reads, or reuse an existing suitable authorized local instance.

## Reading paths

Begin with [START_HERE](START_HERE.md), [ZABBIX_SERVER](ZABBIX_SERVER.md) and the [deployment amendment](../requirements/DEPLOYMENT_UPDATE.md). Then review the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md), [offline contract](OFFLINE_RUNTIME.md), [storage controls](../STORAGE_PLAN.md), [server plan](SERVER_PLAN.md), [ESXi baseline](ESXI_BASELINE.md), architecture and security. Earlier three/four/five-VM tables count NextOps only; the current inclusive profile is in the Zabbix guide.

## Sources and project control

Read [SOURCES](../requirements/SOURCES.md), the [active prompt](../requirements/NEXTOPS_MASTER_PROMPT.md), the [preserved v2 source](../requirements/archive/NEXTOPS_MASTER_PROMPT_v2.0.md), [TRACEABILITY](../requirements/TRACEABILITY.md), [ADRs](../adr/README.md), [PROJECT_STATE](../PROJECT_STATE.md) and [NEXT_TASK](../NEXT_TASK.md). The [Zabbix allocation record](../requirements/ZABBIX_SERVER_PLAN.json) and [deployment amendment](../requirements/DEPLOYMENT_UPDATE.md) distinguish proposed allocations from hardware observations. The [visual review](../VISUAL_REVIEW.md) is not an offline-runtime test.

Every English guide has a same-named Persian counterpart. Update them together. Do not translate executable identifiers, protocol fields or the master prompt. Keep credentials and real infrastructure identifiers out of this public repository. Documentation and calculated budgets are not evidence of installed services or passed tests.
