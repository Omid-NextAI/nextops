# Architecture and repository structure

[فارسی](../fa/ARCHITECTURE.md) · [Index](INDEX.md)

**Status: Phase 0 architecture accepted; the controlled application, static bilingual panel, PostgreSQL state, authenticated CPU inference, and narrow read-only Zabbix connector boundaries are implemented and deployed for user testing.** Durable investigation/audit, server/API WAN isolation, and serial reboot recovery have scoped evidence. A complete MCP gateway, general durable worker, retrieval/topology, remediation, independent recovery, and production acceptance remain future work. See the [release manifest](../status/current-release.yaml) and [project state](../PROJECT_STATE.md).

## Decision

Use a modular control plane, a durable workflow worker, a protected execution gateway, isolated enabled connectors, and one dedicated local CPU inference service. A module is a code boundary; it need not be a microservice. Separate processes where credentials, network reachability, or resource isolation demand it.

## Responsibilities and enforceable boundaries

### Existing connector VM is the MCP boundary

The owner reaffirmed this placement on 2026-10-04. Master specification sections 5 and 12 and
[the server plan](SERVER_PLAN.md) already assign the protected MCP gateway and isolated read-only
runners to **the existing `nextops-connectors-ro` VM**. MCP is its intended application-facing
interface, not a new VM or a permanent competing integration stack beside the connector.

The intended path is application policy and durable audit → authenticated internal MCP gateway
on the connector VM → isolated integration runner → approved target. The application remains the
authorization authority; the gateway rechecks trusted identity/scope and enforces limits. Only the
appropriate runner holds target credentials. Gateway and runners retain separate process/service
identities on the same VM. The AI receives sanitized evidence, never credentials or direct access.

Current deployment still uses the protected HTTP connector. MCP-01 supplies a local SDK foundation,
not the cross-VM gateway deployment. MCP-02/03 migrate and qualify the existing boundary while
reusing its Zabbix/Linux drivers. Retain HTTP only for explicit staged compatibility and exact
rollback; do not relabel it MCP, leave a permanent bypass, or silently fall back to it on MCP denial.
See [the migration requirements](../requirements/MULTI_SOURCE_MCP_SPEC.md).

| Component | Owns | Must not receive/do |
|---|---|---|
| Web/API | Sessions, input validation, inventory views, run submission | Raw target credentials or direct connector access |
| Workflow worker | Bounded planning, evidence collection, checkpoints | Self-granted permissions or gateway bypass |
| CPU inference | Language understanding and evidence synthesis | Target credentials, arbitrary Internet calls, management-network access |
| Policy | Versioned deterministic permissions, risk and approval rules | Model-controlled privilege changes |
| Gateway | Authentication, policy recheck, audit, limits, execution routing | Unauthenticated direct execution |
| Connector | One integration's authorized operations and credentials | Unrestricted discovery or unrelated targets |
| PostgreSQL | Authoritative business/workflow state | A shared superuser account for all components |

Use service identities, scoped database roles, network controls, filesystem permissions, and execution-boundary checks to make these restrictions real. A diagram alone does not enforce isolation.

## Starting stack, not locked dependencies

Python 3.12 is a proposed baseline with FastAPI and Pydantic. PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy and Alembic handle state and migrations. A PostgreSQL-backed job system is preferred initially; Redis is optional only after a measured need. React, TypeScript and Vite are the proposed frontend. Local lexical retrieval and optionally pgvector support evidence search. Generation uses a pinned CPU build of llama.cpp; embeddings use a separately evaluated local CPU model.

Implementation must verify compatible versions and commit dependency locks, image digests, model revisions and checksums. No package in this document is implied to be installed. PostgreSQL is the initial production backend; alternate internal MySQL/SQLite backends remain tracked rather than falsely presented as equivalent.

```

Only create implementation directories when they contain real code or contracts. Define packaging/import roots explicitly. Infrastructure implements domain/application ports, never the reverse. Avoid one giant agent module, broad utility modules and untyped cross-module dictionaries.

## Single-host deployment

Separate development, staging and production credentials, inventories, databases, volumes and ports. All environments still share one host failure domain. Expose only the reverse proxy to intended users; keep inference, database, MCP and telemetry administration internal. Proposed configurable data paths are `/srv/nextops/models`, `/var/lib/nextops`, and `/etc/nextops`; verify actual mounts and ownership first.

Compose and systemd must follow the same contracts with documented limitations. Do not introduce Kubernetes, Kafka, a service mesh, another workflow engine or a graph database without an ADR demonstrating a current requirement. Off-host backups and an access-recovery plan are production gates, not optional decorations.
