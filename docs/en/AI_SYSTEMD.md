# Stage 1B native systemd service profile

**Dated qualification: installed on the authorized AI server; controlled Stage 1B qualification
passed on 2026-09-22 and the answer-integrity qualification passed on 2026-09-26, while production
and full offline acceptance remain open.** These dated results do not qualify a later application
or model; consult the [current release](../status/current-release.yaml), [CPU guide](CPU_AI.md)
and [testing record](TESTING.md) for the actual selected identity and revision-sensitive gates.

Stage 1B uses the native systemd profile under [`deploy/systemd`](../../deploy/systemd). Docker is
not required and no service receives a container socket. The profile separates the pinned llama.cpp
process from the authenticated NextOps inference boundary:

- `nextops-llama.service` loads only the verified local model, uses CPU with zero GPU layers, binds
  to `127.0.0.1:8080`, accepts one runtime slot, disables the Web UI and slot endpoint, and requires
  a provider API key supplied by systemd credentials.
- `nextops-ai.service` binds to `127.0.0.1:8090`, uses a different bearer secret, and exposes the
  tested one-active/two-queued NextOps API. It does not accept client-selected provider URLs, model
  paths, system prompts, tools, agents, or target credentials.

The units clear proxy variables, deny non-loopback IP traffic at the service cgroup, run as the
unprivileged `nextops-ai` identity, make artifact/configuration trees read-only, restrict writable
state and log paths, disable core dumps and Linux capabilities, and set explicit CPU, memory, task,
file, and restart limits. The initial 16-thread llama.cpp setting is a qualification starting point,
not an accepted performance result or a topology claim.

The promoted llama.cpp build keeps its shared libraries beside the executable. The installed unit
sets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the stable protected runtime `bin` directory; this corrects the first live
relocation failure without referencing a developer checkout. Controlled startup waits for the
authenticated model health response, not merely an open socket.

The Python configuration loader accepts systemd `LoadCredential` files, rejects symlinks, multiline
values, oversized files, ambiguous environment-plus-file sources, and world-accessible credential
files on POSIX. Ordinary environment values remain available only for isolated development/tests;
the deployment profile does not use them.

At the 2026-09-26 checkpoint, protected AI release `nextops-0.1.0-fd3c353` was active. It retained the qualified
evidence prompt and adds deterministic evaluation rules that reject prompt echo, invented execution
claims and answers that present model memory as current infrastructure state. The earlier
`62de8d6`, `417d888` and `5de76ac` builds remain historical qualification or rollback evidence, not
the current application. `fd3c353` is also historical; it is not the current serving identity.

## Verified live result

The private evidence record for 2026-09-22 verifies:

1. the runtime and 5,027,783,488-byte model match their pinned SHA-256 values and are reached through
   stable links to immutable protected release directories;
2. two distinct root-owned `0400` credentials are installed without entering Git or logs;
3. both units are enabled and active only on `127.0.0.1:8080` and `127.0.0.1:8090`, and each receives
   `2.7 OK` from `systemd-analyze security`;
4. unauthenticated generation returns `401`, readiness returns `200`, bounded load admits one active
   request and rejects/times out excess work as designed, and two independent Persian/English
   four-case runs passed both automated checks and human review;
5. a cold process restart restored the authenticated services in 109 seconds; the unit network policy
   denied non-loopback IP traffic throughout;
6. application rollback to `417d888` and forward restoration to `62de8d6` both passed authentication
   denial/readiness checks in the 2026-09-22 qualification. The later 2026-09-26 integrity deployment left
   `fd3c353` active and preserves the prior immutable releases.

The private 2026-09-26 integrity report contains eight balanced English/Persian live cases. All
returned HTTP 200 and passed deterministic checks plus engineering semantic review, including
evidence uncertainty, non-execution, greetings and refusal to assert current infrastructure state
without live evidence.

This is a controlled Stage 1B qualification, not production acceptance. Still required are an
authorized VM reboot, an explicit external WAN-disconnection observation, live cancellation and
dependency-failure cases, runtime/model rollback, corrupt or missing artifact behavior, sustained
performance and NUMA thresholds, dependency-license approval, an independent artifact/backup copy,
and an isolated restore. Full Phase 1 also requires the application, PostgreSQL, Zabbix, connector,
browser, audit, and end-to-end offline gates.
