# NextOps Markdown context index

Updated: 2026-10-07

This is the durable inventory and routing map for project-owned Markdown. It lets an agent remember
that every document exists without flooding each task with every file. The documentation validator
requires every project Markdown file to appear exactly once in the complete inventory below.

این فایل فهرست ماندگار همهٔ مستندات Markdown پروژه است. عامل باید ابتدا بر اساس نوع کار،
فقط سندهای مرتبط را از مسیرهای زیر بخواند؛ فهرست کامل به معنی بارگذاری هم‌زمان همهٔ فایل‌ها
نیست.

## Core context for every task

Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`, and `docs/NEXT_TASK.md`. Use this index to choose the
remaining task-specific sources. The repository skill
`.agents/skills/nextops-project-context/SKILL.md` defines precedence and conflict handling.

## Task routing

| Task | Read before acting |
